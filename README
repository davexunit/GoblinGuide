FAQScaper - A simple GameFAQs scraper for GNU/Linux
---------------------------------------------------

Purpose
-------
To give myself (AND YOU!) an easy way to search for and download game guides to read with my favorite text editor without needing to use a web browser.
... And to learn curses and screen scraping. :]
