FAQ Scaper
---------
FAQ Scraper is a simple GameFAQs scraper for GNU/Linux with an ncurses user interface.
In addition to searching and viewing FAQs, FAQ Scraper can store a compendium of your favorite game guides for quick viewing later.
I wrote this app to learn curses and screen scraping but to my surprise I found FAQ Scraper to be quite a convenient way to quickly download game guides and view them in my text editor of preference.
Maybe you can find FAQ Scraper useful, too!
