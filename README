Goblin Guide
---------
Goblin Guide is a GameFAQs scraper for GNU/Linux.
It is written to fulfill my personal desire of being able to quickly open text
game guides from GameFAQs in my preferred text editor, directly from the
terminal.
Goblin Guide downloads and keeps the guides locally for convenience as a lot of
guides can be quite large in file size.
